# Boolean-Algebra-Interpreter
Interpreter for basic boolean algebra.

## Stage 1

* Read a text input of parameters and logical operators into an equation object.
* Given an equation make a truth table of the equation.
* Determine if an equation is a Tautology, a Contradiction or Neither.
* Compare two equations and determine if they are equal.

## Stage 2

* Have a GUI to read in equations and display their values in a nice way.
* Simplify a boolean equations by the Karnaugh Map Algorithm or Quine McCluskey Algorithm.
* Simplify a boolean equation using only the specified logical operators.

## Stage 3

* Implement Stage 1 and 2 for finite n-valued logic.
